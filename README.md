# WP-Astra-Sticky-Header
  WP Astra free version doesn't have the sticky header settings option.
  So you have to find a workaround for it by adding custom code.
  Follow these steps if you want to do so.
  
  1. Copy the CSS code into the custom CSS area or any other place you prefer.
  2. Copy the JS code into any place you prefer. In my case, I use WPCode and paced it right after the opening body tag.
